**Features:**  
• Shows in the food name wheter it's raw (yellow), cooked (green), overcooked (red) or burnt (red);
• Shows a percentage when cooking food. Between 0 and 100% the food is considered raw, between 100 and 150% the food is properly cooked, above 150% it's burnt. Stop cooking when the food name is green for the maximum effect;  
• Shows a "loading bar" type of thing when cooking or drying food;  
• Shows a bar for food spoilage;  
• The mod can be configured from a dedicated config file. To do so after running the game with the mod once, go to *...\Sailwind\BepInEx\config\pr0skynesis.cookedinfo.cfg* and make the change you want. Currently you can disable the loading bar, the percentage and/or the colored text;
